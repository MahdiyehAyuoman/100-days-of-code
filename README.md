100-Days-of-Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp
Welcome to my journey through the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp".

This repository is dedicated to my progress in this comprehensive Python course. Over the next 100 days, I am committing to spending at least one hour a day to build a new project and master Python programming.

About the Course
This course, taught by Angela Yu at the App Brewery, is designed to take students from absolute beginners to professional developers. It focuses on a practical, project-based approach to learning, covering a vast range of topics including:

Python Fundamentals

Automation and Scripting

Web Scraping (Beautiful Soup, Selenium)

Data Science (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Game Development (Turtle)

Web Development (Flask, APIs, Databases)

Git and GitHub Version Control

Project Structure
Each day's project is stored in its own dedicated folder, named according to the day and project title. For example:

Day-15-Coffee-Machine

Day-16-Another-Project

...and so on.

Feel free to explore my progress and the projects I have built. Your feedback and support are always welcome!
